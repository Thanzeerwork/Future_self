### Request Examples

#### Generate Test Questions
```javascript
const questions = await llmTestService.generateTestQuestions(
  'Coding',           // Category
  'Intermediate',     // Difficulty
  10,                 // Question count
  'React'             // Custom topic (optional)
);
```

#### Evaluate Answer
```javascript
const evaluation = await llmTestService.evaluateAnswer(
  question,           // Question object
  userAnswer,         // User's selected answer
  userExplanation     // User's explanation (optional)
);
```
